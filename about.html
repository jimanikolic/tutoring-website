        <p>Hello! <br> <br> 
            
        My name is Jim and I am a currently enrolled 
        D1 student at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry. 
        I graduated spring of 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in mathematics.<br><br>
    
        I have been tutoring at the college and high-school 
        level for about five years and have grown to adore it!
        <br><br>
    
        I love tutoring because it's a chance to connect 
        with others and share the joy of learning. Being 
        part of someone's educational journey is incredibly 
        rewarding, as I get to witness students grow 
        into more confident, curious individuals. 
        <br><br>
        
        It's not 
        just about teaching; it's about building meaningful
        connections and helping people discover their own
        unique path to success. <br><br>
    
        <strong>I look forward to meeting you!</strong>
