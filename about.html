    <p>
        Hello! My name is Jim, and I am currently a D2 student at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry.
        I graduated in Spring 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
        <br><br>
        I have been tutoring college and high-school students for about six years and have grown to truly enjoy it.
        Teaching gives me the chance to connect with others and share the excitement of learning.
        Watching students grow into confident, curious thinkers is incredibly rewarding.
        <br><br>
        It's more than just teaching—it's about making meaningful connections and helping others discover their own path to success.
        <br><br>
        <strong>I look forward to meeting you!</strong>
    </p>
